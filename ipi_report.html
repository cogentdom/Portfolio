            <p>Idaho Policy Institute</p>
            <h5>Objective of the Project</h5>
            <p>Find conections between financial spending and crime</p>
            <h3>Understanding the Initial Dataset</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>who gave us the data</li>
                <li>how did they collect this data</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h5>Data Manual</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Exploring & Modeling of Municipial Dataset:</h3>
            <p>This is a project presented to my partners and me by our client, The Idaho Policy Institute, In which they provided a dataset containing information on finances, population and crime for virtually every city and/or county in Idaho. The goal of the project was to find relationships between financial decisions with crime and employment trends in cities of Idaho with efferent sizes.</p>
            <h3>Functions We Created:</h3>
            <p>We created many functions and methods to augment our work such as converting to real dollars using the current year as a parameter. We also did this to regularize some of our variables. Furthermore there are many plotting functions such as heat maps, matricies of distributions and scatter plots, choropleth maps , etc. These methods and functions are all stored within the support folder and have their own documentation. These were hidden for aesthetics and need not be read to understand the process of this notebook.</p>
