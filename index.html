                    This website is being updated and will always be updating as I always do something new. 
                    You will find recent posts about my projects below, please check them out.
                    <!-- Hello, and welcome! This is the site where I showcase my open source projects providing an interface to clearly portray insights along with the tools necessary for community contribution.
                    I hope that these projects continue to grow and become a platform to attract curious minds allowing them to carve their own path to greatness.

                    To give you an idea of who I am I believe the following provides a good description: 
                </p><p>    
                    A zealous campaigner utilizing a multidisciplinary skill set by developing strategies driven by data. 
                    I define myself on the ability to bolster anyone's workflow, acting as a conduit to channel collaboration thereby propelling the project forward.

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    A zealous campaigner equipped with a multidisciplinary skill set that leverages data to drive strategic planning and development. 
                    I define myself on the ability to bolster anyone's workflow, acting as a conduit to channel collaboration thereby propelling projects forward. </p>   
                <p>
                    Technically resourceful individual possessing expertise in statistical model development and scalable data storage. 
                    Specifically, skilled in scrutinizing large data sets through a combination of architecture and machine learning to yield signal within the engulfing noise. </p>
                <p>    
                    I use this data science approach to better understand the world through the lens of an economist. 
                    With this lens I see the world as an interconnected network of systems waiting to be optimized. 
                    Harnessing this knowledge has a nearly endless reach, providing invaluable benefits such as allowing a city to automate their traffic lights, identifying the bottleneck task of a project or providing insight on how to most effectively invest resources. </p>

                        <p>Harnessing the power of machine learning this project offers retail stores a more efficient solution to their supply chain by identifying future sales of inventory. 
                            Allowing retailers to act preemptively and avoid negative effects from a bull whip along the supply chain. </p>

                    <!-- Financial Spending Model -->
                    <h5><a href="ipi_report.html" style="color: #3366cc;">Financial Spending</a></h5>
                    <section class="h5_sec">
                        <p>A three month service learning project for the Idaho Policy Institute(IPI); 
                            this is a project I completed for my graduate data science course at Boise State. 
                            This Project successfully makes use of Idaho's municipal government financial data by providing insightful models to augment the decision making process. 
                            This specifically correlates government expenditure and crime allowing for the optimization of all future investments. </p>
